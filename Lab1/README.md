# CS372 Lab 1
## Files
Besides this README.md file, the only other file, Lab1.java, is what houses the 2 implementations of the fibonacci sequence algorithms, named FirstAttempt and SecondAttempt.

## Compiling Lab1.java
To run this file in the terminal, you'll first need to be in the directory it is housed in. Then you'll need to compile said file. For example, if I were to compile Lab1.java on the CS machines here on campus after I got to the directory my file was on I would run the commands...

    javac Lab1.java
    java Lab1
